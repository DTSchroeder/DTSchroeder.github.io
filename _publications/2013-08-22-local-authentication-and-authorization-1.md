Many cloud solutions are a combination of complex components, which require a lot of time to install and to configure. This includes the setup or the adjustment of firewall policies and changes of many other system and infrastructure settings. Furthermore, additional software products are required, especially to setup a suitable and complex identity management. In this paper, we introduce a concept, which enables a fast and immediate setup of cloud environment without a time-consuming overhead for installation and configuration of third-party solutions for identity management. The mapping between cloud resources to the permission management of any Unix-like operating system plays the central role, besides a strong separation of cloud middleware and operating System interactions.
