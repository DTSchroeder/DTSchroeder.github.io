The FakeNews: Corona Virus and 5G Conspiracy task, running for the first time as part of MediaEval 2020, focuses on the classification of tweet texts and retweet cascades for the detection of fast-spreading misinformation, and therefore provides a lowthreshold introduction to natural language processing and graph analysis. This paper describes the task, including use case and motivation, challenges, the dataset with ground truth, the required participant runs, and the evaluation metrics.
