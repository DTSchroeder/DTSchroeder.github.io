In recent years, online social networks have become crucial for news and political debates, but the spread of fake news and harmful misinformation is a growing concern. Understanding social networks is essential to comprehend the phenomenon of fake news, particularly the connectivity between participants, which reveals communication patterns that impact the spread of ideas. Twitter, due to its public nature, offers a research opportunity without privacy concerns, but gathering sufficient data poses a challenge. This paper presents a scalable framework for collecting follower networks, posts, and profiles to enable high-performance social network analysis.
