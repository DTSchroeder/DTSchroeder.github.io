Online social networks like Facebook and Twitter have become integral to people's daily lives, serving as platforms for interaction, information acquisition, and knowledge gain; however, accessing and extracting data from these networks is often constrained by complex APIs and data scraping limitations, leading to restricted research access and shared quotas, necessitating the development of a proxy server presented in this paper that enables cooperative management of researchers' data contingents, facilitating seamless integration of multiple API accessing programs within the same research group without incurring performance penalties or implementation overhead.
