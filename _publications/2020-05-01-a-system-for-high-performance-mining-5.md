We design a system for efficient in-memory analysis of data from the GDELT database of news events. The specialization of the system allows us to avoid the inefficiencies of existing alternatives, and make full use of modern parallel high-performance computing hardware. We then present a series of experiments showcasing the system's ability to analyze correlations in the entire GDELT 2.0 database containing more than a billion news items. The results reveal large scale trends in the world of today's online news.
