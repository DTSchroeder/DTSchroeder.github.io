The FakeNews: Corona Virus and Conspiracies Multimedia Analysis task, running for the second time as part of MediaEval 2021, focuses on the classification of tweet texts aiming detection of fastspreading misinformation. Task of this year extends the number of target conspiracy theories and introduces new challenges in terms of analysis complexity of the imbalanced dataset. This paper describes the task, including use case and motivation, challenges, the dataset with ground truth, the required participant runs, and the evaluation metrics.
