excerpt: 'The paper presents a method to calculate an acquaintance score between Twitter users for analyzing information propagation. The proposed method considers response time and enables time-based spreading comparisons. This approach addresses the need for obtaining weighted edges from communication on social networks and enables the detection of unusual communication patterns.'

Online social networks enable large-scale analysis of human behavior, which was previously infeasible for social scientists. The relationship between users on social networks can be described as a graph, either undirected or directed. However, these edges are unweighted expressions of interest and do not reflect how individuals interact with each other. Therefore, obtaining weighted edges from communication on social networks is necessary for studying information propagation. In this paper, a novel method is presented to calculate an acquaintance score between pairs of Twitter users, enabling the analysis of interaction-based information propagation. The score considers response time as a crucial factor and enables time-based spreading comparisons, unlike previous work that assigns edge weights based on tie strength.
