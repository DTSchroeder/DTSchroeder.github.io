Online social networks are ubiquitous and have become an essential part of our daily lives. They not only mirror society but act as petri dishes for discourse, sometimes with fatal consequences. Understanding the dynamics underlying such platforms promises new models for predicting, e.g., the consequences of misinformation. Compared to individual-based platforms like Twitter or Facebook, Reddit is inherently topic-based. The Reddit universe consists of subreddits that represent sets of individuals gathering around certain themes. This paper aims to understand the dynamics of evolving fields of common interest by analyzing temporal networks induced by Reddit user activity using community detection.
