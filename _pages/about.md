Daniel Thilo Schroeder is a postdoc at Simula Research Laboratory, an associate professor at Oslo Metropolitan University, and a former research associate at the Technical University of Berlin. With a background in the development of complex and distributed IT systems for large-scale data processing, he recently worked on the analysis of online social networks. His current research aims to develop more universal methodologies to understand the interactions underlying the spread of misinformation with harmful consequences on a societal scale. Additionally, he is involved in projects with the goal to investigate the impact of misinformation on crisis regions in Mali and Ethiopia, as well as projects aiming to improve the graph methods necessary to study news-spreading phenomena on a large scale.
