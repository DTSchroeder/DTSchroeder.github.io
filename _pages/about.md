Daniel Thilo Schroeder is a Research Scientist at SINTEF and an associate professor at Oslo Metropolitan University. He has previously worked as a research associate at the Technical University of Berlin and the Simula Research Laboratory. With a background in developing complex and distributed IT systems for large-scale data processing, his recent focus has been on analyzing online social networks.

Dr. Schroeder's current research aims to develop more universal methodologies for understanding the interactions that underlie the spread of misinformation and its harmful consequences on a societal level. He is also involved in projects investigating the impact of misinformation on crisis regions in Mali and Ethiopia. Additionally, he contributes to projects aimed at improving graph methods used to study the spreading of news on a large scale.

Through his diverse research contributions, Dr. Schroeder is making valuable strides in deepening our understanding of misinformation and its societal implications.
