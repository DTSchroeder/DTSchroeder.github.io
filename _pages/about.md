As a Research Scientist at [SINTEF](https://www.sintef.no/en/)'s [Smart Data](https://www.sintef.no/en/expertise/digital/sustainable-communication-technologies/smart-data/) group, I work closely with [Dumitru Roman](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=-B2n3KsAAAAJ&hl=no) on the [Graph-Massivizer](https://graph-massivizer.eu/) project. Here, we aim to develop a high-performance, scalable, and sustainable platform capable of processing and reasoning about extreme data through massive graph representation. By leveraging serverless computing, our project empowers various organizations to efficiently manage extreme data via massive graph programming and processing.

At the same time, I am involved in the [enRichMyData](https://enrichmydata.eu/) project. In this initiative, we're crafting a new paradigm for building rich, high-quality, valuable, and FAIR-compliant datasets, which are vital for the success of Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence applications. We focus on streamlining the specification and execution of data enrichment pipelines, a critical but often time-consuming process which involves data discovery, cleaning, transformation, and integration. Our goal is to make these steps more accessible and cost-effective for a broad range of organizations, particularly those facing challenges in delivering suitable data due to a lack of usable tools or expertise in managing data enrichment pipelines.

In my capacity as an Associate Professor at the [Oslo Metropolitan University](https://www.oslomet.no/), I'm part of the [DD-MAC](https://decodingdigitalmedia.org/) project. This project is committed to understanding the role of social media in conflict regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Here, I'm privileged to collaborate with [Kristin Skare Orgeret](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J9G5b3sAAAAJ&hl=en), [Bruce Mutsvairo](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=jPj89kIAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Mirjam de Bruijn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-VvmgAMAAAAJ&hl=en). Our efforts center on collecting empirical evidence from Ethiopia and Mali to understand the influence of digital communication on conflict development and mediation. By employing a multi-disciplinary approach and diverse methodologies, we study social media usage dynamics, the spread of disinformation and hate speech, the role of diasporas in conflicts, and the relationship between digital and traditional media in regions with low internet connectivity.

During my postdoc in [Simula](https://www.simula.no/)'s Department for [Department of High Performance Computing](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/department-high-performance-computing), I worked with [Johannes Langguth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ilbKQMYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Xing Cai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IWQbrcK5CEwC&hl=en), and [Fredrik Manne](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=K-N0vTcAAAAJ&hl=no). Here, we focused on the development of a new computational framework for Graph Neural Networks with the goal of extending deep learning capabilities to unstructured data.

Under the supervision of Professor [Odej Kao](https://scholar.google.no/citations?hl=no&user=mvOSfFAAAAAJ) from the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), in collaboration with [Carsten Griwodz](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=l2Q_qY0cRkgC&hl=no), [Pål Halvorsen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hru0ei0AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Michael Riegler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vd_ApDoAAAAJ&hl=en) from the [Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering](https://www.simulamet.no/), I received my PhD as part of [Johannes Langguth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ilbKQMYAAAAJ&hl=en)'s [UMOD](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/umod-understanding-and-monitoring-digital-wildfires) project. This project centered on understanding and monitoring of digital wildfires or the rapid spread of online misinformation with the goal to identify harmful misinformation early, analyze its potential threat, and devise effective prevention and preparedness strategies.

<!-- As a Research Scientist at SINTEF's Smart Data group, I collaborate closely with Dumitru Roman on the Graph-Massivizer Project. Our goal is to establish a high-performance, scalable, and sustainable platform capable of processing and reasoning extreme data via massive graph representation. We are developing an open-source toolkit and FAIR graph datasets that encourage holistic usability, automated intelligence, performance modeling, and environmentally conscious trade-offs. By harnessing the capabilities of serverless computing, our project enables various organizations to handle extreme data efficiently through massive graph programming and processing. Our contributions promise marked improvements in analytic efficiency, energy mindfulness, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

Simultaneously, I'm deeply engaged in the enRichMyData project. In this venture, we're forging a new paradigm for constructing rich, high-quality, valuable, and FAIR-compliant datasets that are crucial for the success of Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Our focus is on facilitating the specification and execution of data enrichment pipelines, a vital but often time-consuming process in AI and BDA projects, involving data discovery, cleaning, transformation, and integration. We aim to make these steps more accessible and cost-effective for a wide array of organizations, especially those that face challenges in delivering suitable data due to the absence of usable tools or expertise in managing data enrichment pipelines. Through these efforts, we aspire to boost the overall quality of BDA and AI applications within data-sharing ecosystems.

In my role as Associate Professor at Oslo Metropolitan University, I am involved in the DDMAC project, an initiative dedicated to examining the role of social media in conflict regions of sub-Saharan Africa. I have the privilege to collaborate with esteemed colleagues, Kristin Skare Orgeret, Bruce Mutsvairo, and Mirjam de Bruijn. Our collective efforts focus on gathering empirical data from Ethiopia and Mali, with the objective of understanding the impact of digital communication on conflict development and mediation. Employing a multi-disciplinary approach and a wide range of methodologies, we are studying the dynamics of social media usage, the dissemination of disinformation and hate speech, the involvement of diasporas in conflicts, and the correlation between digital and traditional media in regions with low internet connectivity.

In my previous job as a postdoc in Simula's Department of High Performance Computing, I collaborated with Johannes Langguth, Xing Cai, and Fredrik Manne on developing a new computational framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our primary focus was to extend deep learning capabilities to unstructured data, but the challenge was the scaling inefficiency of GNNs across multiple processors. We sought to overcome this limitation by automating GNN distribution over parallel systems, thus facilitating the real-world application of these networks.

Working under the supervision of Odej Kao at the Technical University of Berlin and in collaboration with Carsten Griwodz, Pål Halvorsen, and Michael Riegler from the Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering, I completed my PhD as part of Johannes Langguth's EGNE Project. Currently, I am involved in the UMOD Project that focuses on understanding and monitoring digital wildfires, or the rapid spread of online misinformation. We are developing an automated system capable of detecting and assessing the propagation of such misinformation, taking into account both technical and human factors. Our aim is to identify harmful misinformation early, analyze its potential threat, and devise effective prevention and preparedness strategies.

Guided by Professor Odej Kao from the Technical University of Berlin and in collaboration with Carsten Griwodz, Pål Halvorsen, and Michael Riegler from the Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering, I completed my PhD as part of Johannes Langguth's UMOD Project. This project focused on understanding and mitigating the risk of digital wildfires - the rapid online spread of misinformation. We combined technical tools with the study of human behavior to investigate how trustworthiness is gauged online and why misinformation gets propagated. Furthermore, we developed algorithms to analyze the propagation of news from its original source and implemented discourse analysis to assess the content, agendas, and potential threat detected misinformation. -->
